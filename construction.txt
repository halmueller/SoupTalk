From crummy.com:
"I used to ask for donations from people who used Beautiful Soup.
But I didn't write Beautiful Soup to make money. I wrote it to make the world a better place.
I wrote it to be a tool for good.
If you've used Beautiful Soup over the past 10+ years and want to say thank you, the best way is to be thoughtful about how you use it.
You have power. Use it to make things better."
